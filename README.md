# Lithos LitePaper
For many years, attempts to make efficient, decentralized mining pools have failed or petered out after time. Although some instances of decentralized pools have existed many faced issues such as security concerns, lack of miner usage, and failures to achieve both efficiency and full decentralization. Innovation in mining pool infrastructure and software has also stopped, with Stratum v1 being the standard mode of communication for sending and receiving work to mining pools. *Lithos* proposes a new solution to the decentralized pool problem, one which also brings signifcant benefits to miners outside of just decentralization.

## NISPs

Non-Interactive Share Proofs (NISPs) are one half of the Lithos protocol. NISPs allow for work created by miners, shares, to be compressed down and efficiently calculated so that miners can be paid fairly according to the shares they submitted. NISPs revolutionize decentralized pools by allowing work to be calculated within on-chain smart contracts. Moreover, NISPs place more power into the hands of miners. NISP protocols allow miners to choose their own share difficulty, and in turn, their own risk to reward ratio when receiving rewards.

## Collateralization
Collateralization serves as the second half which backs the Lithos protocol. Collateralizized mining pools allow for local block creation and full censorship resistance. Miners may choose whatever transactions make it into their block, and may also set parameters related to governance of the Ergo blockchain. Collateralization also means that
